  abstract={Reduced Order Models are applied to predict pressure distributions on a civil aircraft, at various combinations of Mach number and angle of attack. The efficiency of a pointwise method (computing individual Cp values from the wall point location and the flow conditions) and several modewise methods (computing wall Cp distributions from the flow conditions) including POD, IsoMap, Diffusion Map and Autoencoder, is assessed and discussed.}
